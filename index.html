        The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, 
        is the world's dominant software platform.[1] It was originally 
        a hypertext document management system[2] accessed over the Internet.
        [3] The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol 
        (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, 
        and are published by a software application called a web server. 
        Web resources may be any type of downloaded media, 
        but web pages are hypertext documents formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). 
        Special HTML syntax displays embedded hyperlinks with URLs, 
        which permits users to navigate to other web resources. 
        In addition to text, web pages may contain references to images, 
        video, audio, and software components, which are either displayed or 
        internally executed in the user's web browser to render pages or streams 
        of multimedia conten</p>

        With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be 
        embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured 
        documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, 
        lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, 
        written using angle brackets. </p>
